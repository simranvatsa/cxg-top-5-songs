## #CrazyExTop5
I analyzed tweets containing #CrazyExTop5, a hashtag that trended April 3 and 4 (yesterday and today) in the Twitter fan community for the CW show "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend", the final episode for which airs tomorrow (April 5). I used R for my analysis. 

The final dataset and my methodology can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1In0q5oSTKthXoW3nEb0Gl2Cefmm4KjPTHsMGDloQJ34/edit#gid=0). The code, and some intermediate datasets, are in this repo.
